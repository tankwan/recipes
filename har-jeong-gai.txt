Ingredients:

Part A

1 kg chicken mid wings
3 Tbl Shrimp sauce
2 tsp sugar
2 Tbl Sesame Oil
3 Tbl Chinese Wine,
1 teaspoon white pepper
2 teaspoon MSG (optional, but don’t blame me if it doesn’t taste like the real deal)

Part B

80g Plain Flour
80g Potato Starch
1 egg
100ml water
1/4 tsp Bicarb,
1/4 teasoon baking powder

Mix all the ingredients in Part A together till the chicken is evenly coated. Mix all the ingredients in Part B together till you get a smooth batter and add this to the marinated chicken. Mix well and place in a plastic container to marinade for 8 hours or up to 2 days.

Heat oil to 180°C and drop a few wings into the batter. After about half a minute, use a pair of chopsticks to separate the wings so they don’t stick together. After about 1 minute, the oil temperature should have dropped to 160°C if not lower the heat. Cook for 4 mins or until golden brown. Serve with a squeeze of calamansi and sweet chilli sauce (optional).
